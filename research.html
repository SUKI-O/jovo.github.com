	Our research for the last several years has been devoted to the extension and application of scalable statistical inference methodologies to discover structure from multiple multiscale multidimensional multispectral multimodal multifarious data.  Our primary motivation is the discovery of principles relating brain structure and dynamics to behavior and cognition.  Our work can be organized into computational statistical methods operating on objects in various domains, including graphs, time-series, shapes, images, and of course, classical Euclidean objects.

<ul>
	
	<li><strong>Graph Analysis: </strong>
	We have developed a number of methodologies that operate directly on large graphs.  This includes hypothesis testing for graphs, classifying graphs, matching graphs, embedding graphs, computing distances between graphs, computing multivariate invariants of massive graphs,  vertex clustering, vertex classification, estimating the reliability of graphs, and optimal graph inference under constraints.  Our primary applications of this work including discovering the variability in brain-graphs as a function of various phenotypes, including species, sex, and skills.

	<li><strong>Time-Series Analysis: </strong>
		We have developed a number of methodologies that are essentially generalizations linear deconvolution, including non-negative constraints, integer constraints, and nonlinear and non-Gaussian observation functions. These include highly scalable methods for voxel-wise fMRI applications, real-time methods for spike sorting from neurophysiology data, and population calcium imaging methods.  We have also developed methods for clustering multivariate time-series to explore larval Drosophila behavior.

		<li><strong>Shape Analysis: </strong>
		We are developing a number of tools for the analysis of shapes, including multispectral three-dimensional closed contours.  The primary applications of this work are studying the synaptic and cellular morphological diversity in the brain.
		
		<li><strong>Image Analysis: </strong>
		We are developing scalable methods to perform a number of image processing tasks such as two- and three-dimensional image alignment, color correction, color compression, and multispectral alignment.  Similarly, we are working on a variety of  computer vision tasks, including three-dimensional (and sometimes multispectral and multi-resolution) object detection, tracking, and scene segmentation. The primary applications of this work are in automating image analysis for massive neuroscientific image stacks.  The data derivatives from this work, therefore, feed into the graph, time-series, and shape analyses mentioned above. 


		<li><strong>Euclidean Analysis: </strong>
		We are also developing scalable methods to analyze Euclidean data, specializing in data where the dimensionality is far larger than the sample size, and potentially has outliers and/or missing data.  For example, we are currently developing scalable classification algorithms. Preliminary results suggest that are methods are more scalable, more accurate, and more simple, than previous efforts.

		<li><strong>Multimodal Analysis: </strong>
		We are also developing scalable methods to analyze data coming from multiple different modalities, such as graphs, text, and images.  Preliminary applications including cancer biomarker discovery from clinical, imaging, and genetic data as well as personality prediction from functional and structural connectomes.


		<li><strong>Scalable Infrastructure: </strong>
		We have built a scalable database cluster to support open access machine vision and statistical analysis of the kinds of data described above. This includes heterogeneous hardware architectures and distributed processing.
