	Our research for the last several years has been devoted to the extension and application of scalable statistical inference methodologies to discover structure from multiple multiscale multidimensional multispectral multimodal multifarious data.  Our primary motivation is the discovery of principles relating brain structure and dynamics to behavior and cognition.  As different spatiotemporal scales are optimal for different neurobiological questions, our work spans from single molecules to communities and from milliseconds to lifetimes.  To a first approximation, we characterize the brain as an attributed graph, where vertices are neurons and edges are synapses.  Thus, we explore brain structure, brain dynamics, and brain connectivity, as part of a brain graph exploration.

<p></p><h3>Brain Structure</h3>

 

	The vertices and edges of brain graphs can be arbitrarily complex.  For example, at the microscale, array tomography data provides us with multispectral volumetric images at sub-micron resolution, where each color channel corresponds to the spatial distribution of \emph{in situ} protein expression.  We are using these data to learn a data-driven taxonomy of synaptic diversity. We have also developed scalable methods for synapse detection from nanoscale serial electron microscopy and histogram normalization for streaming gigabyte images.


	<p></p><h3>Brain Dynamics</h3>


	We have developed a number of methods to estimate single cell neural activity via calcium imaging of large populations of neurons and estimating connectivity amongst the neurons.  We have also developed methods for spike sorting and decoding electrophysiological signals. In complementary efforts, we are developing  time-series methods to analyze functional MRI data (with >100k dimensions)  that yield estimates of connectivity. 


	<p></p><h3>Brain Connectivity</h3>



	We have developed a number of methodologies that operate directly on large graphs. These methods are agnostic with regard to the source (electrons or photons), modality (structural or dynamical), scale (nano, micro or meso), or size (thousands or millions of vertices) of the graphs.  This includes hypothesis testing for graphs, classifying graphs, matching graphs, embedding graphs, computing distances between graphs, computing multivariate invariants of massive graphs,   vertex clustering, vertex classification, estimating the reliability of graphs, and optimal graph inference under constraints.  


<p></p>	<h3>Behavior</h3>



	As a first foray into studying the behavior generated by neural circuits, we have been studying time-varying behavior of Drosophila larva under optogenetic stimulation of small subsets of neurons.  Similarly, we are exploring the relationship between whole-brain functional MRI activity and personality type.


<p></p>	<h3>Scalable Infrastructure</h3>



	We have built a scalable database cluster to support open access machine vision and statistical analysis of such data.  On this system, we run our modular scalable computer vision pipeline for nano and microscale data.  Similarly, at the mesoscale, we have developed a similar pipelines for diffusion and functional MRI.   The output of all of these pipelines includes attributed brain-graphs.
