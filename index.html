                     <p> I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of <a href="http://www.bme.jhu.edu/">Biomedical Engineering</a> and the <a href="http://www.icm.jhu.edu/">Institute for Computational Medicine</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins University</a>.  I sit at the <a href="http://cis.jhu.edu/">Center for Imaging Science</a> in Clark Hall at the Homewood campus.  I also have an appointment in the <a href="http://idies.jhu.edu/">Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Sciences</a>.  My work focuses largely on big and wide data, especially neuroscience, focusing on statistics of brain graphs (connectomes).  I co-founded the <a href="http://ocp.me">Open Connectome Project</a> (OCP) with my brother R. Jacob Vogelstein and <a href="http://hssl.cs.jhu.edu/~randal/">Randal Burns</a>, Associated Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University. Recently it has spawned <a href="http://neurodata.io">NeuroData</a> which is the mother of several complementary projects, including  OCP, Open Synaptome Project, and more.
                        We run a very vertical group, with people working at all levels of analysis, ranging from data collection to analysis and interpretation.  We are always looking for new collaborators and team members.  Please <a href="mailto:jovo@jhu.edu">inquire</a> if you are interested.

                    <p>We seek patterns in our physical worlds (e.g., our bodies, our brains) as well as our mental worlds (e.g., our perceptions, experiences, memories, thoughts, emotions, psychiatric conditions).  More importantly, we seek to understand patterns in our mental worlds <em>in terms of</em> our physical worlds. Our hope and belief is that via developing a deeper understanding of the links between these worlds, we will be able to bring them into greater alignment. A primary motivating factor is that all humans/animals have brains and therefore, such ideas could directly benefit all of animalkind. Thus, all of our research products are freely available to all.

                    <h1>research</h1>
                    <p>The fundamental driving force of science is the discovery of latent structure that converts myriad disparate data  into understanding. In the 21st century, the growth of data acquisition has greatly outpaced the growth of data analysis, rendering current computational and statistical tools insufficient for extracting meaning from large datasets. Neuroscience is particularly susceptible to these big data challenges, as neuroexperimentalists have devised methods of collecting terabytes of data per hour. Without statistical and computational frameworks for analysis and organization of these data, the field will be unable to fully reap the benefits of this enormous potential. Our expertise in (i)  computer science, (ii) data curation, (iii) statistical science,  and (iv) neuroscience  enables us to fill this gap. Below we elaborate on these four threads.
                    </p>

                    <h3>statistical science</h3>

                    <p>Statistical sciences have developed a beautiful corpus of knowledge on inference in various settings over the last 100 years.  However, in recent years, new experimental and data collection methods have yielded datasets that no longer fit within the assumptions upon which that body of literature rests.  We therefore  focus  on building statistical methods for 21st century data, including: time-series, graphs, shapes, vectors, and arbitrary metric-valued data.
<!--                         <ul>
                            <li><strong>time-series</strong> 
                                <a href="https://github.com/jovo/smc-oopsi">sequential monte carlo</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jovo/oopsi">non-negative deconovlution</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jovo/spike-sorting">dictionary learning</a>, <a href="https://github.com/decarlson/opass">variational inference</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/shachen/PLDS"> high-dimensional system identification</a>;</li>
                                <li><strong>graphs</strong> inference of graphs, supervised and unsupervised vertex clustering, similarity and dissimilarity metrics, graph matching, and population theory including graph classification and joint embedding;</li>

                                <li><strong>shapes</strong> <a href="https://github.com/mkazhdan/ShapeSPH">non-parametric shape descriptors</a> and  <a href="http://cis.jhu.edu/software/">nonlinear diffeomorphisms</a> for statistical analysis of big shapes;</li>

                            </ul> -->
                        </p>

                    <h3>computer science</h3>

                    <p>Statistical methods require computational implementations. Moreover, the raw data of the 21st century is not typically in a form immediately amenable to statistical analysis; rather, various data wrangling/munging/pre-processing is typically beneficial.   We therefore develop computational tools to enable principled statistical inference on such data.  This includes: petascale data management, interactive visualizations, streaming image processing, distributed computer vision, and scalable machine learning libraries.  We are adherents to the philosophies of open science, our code is always open source.  Thus,  <a href="https://github.com/jovo" target="_blank">my personal github account</a> contains many repos including code from publications prior to launching  <a href="https://neurodata.io/">NeuroData</a> and  <a href="http://flashx.io/" target="_blank">FlashX</a> (links contain all the relevant code repos). 

<!--                         <ul>
                        <li><strong>petascale data management</strong> including <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/open-connectome"><em>spatial databases</em></a> for 3D+ (multispectral or time-series) image data including voxel-wise metadata, and  <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/m2g"><em>grute databases</em></a>  for populations of massive graphs with rich attributes, as well as MATLAB and Python APIs, a content distribution system, LIMS, and hardware configuration;</li> 

                            <li><strong>interactive visualizations</strong> including for multispectral annotated 3D+ big <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/NeuroDataViz">images</a>, <a href="http://gx.neurodata.io">graphs</a>, and <a href="http://vx.neurodata.io">vectors</a>.</li>

                            <li><strong>streaming image processing</strong> including both <a href="https://github.com/mkazhdan/DMG">2D stitching artifact correction</a>  and <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Code/GradientDomainFusion/Version1.0/">3D</a>  histogram normalization;</li>

                            <li><strong>distributed computer vision</strong> including graph inference from <a href="http://i2g.io/">serial electron microscopy</a>, calcium imaging,  <a href="http://fcp-indi.github.io/">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a>, <a href="https://github.com/neurodata/ndmg">diffusion tensor imaging</a> , and object detection in both <a href="http://docs.neurodata.io/vesicle/">MATLAB</a> and <a href="http://docs.neurodata.io/nddocs/#parse">Python</a>;</li>

                            <li><strong>scalable machine learning libraries</strong> (<a href="http://flashx.io">FlashX</a>) including FlashGraph for billion vertex graph analytics using various graph traversal algorithms, FlashMatrix for matrix applications such as svd, pca, k-means, and linear classification, and FlashR for usability;  </li>

                        </ul> -->
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="data">big data curation</h3>

                    <p>To answer any of the below questions, using any of the above statistical methods and computational tools, fundamentally requires data.  Much like all of our code is open source, all of our data is open access.  Moreover, we provide it in a fashion immediately amenable to analysis for everyone, including electron microscopy, array tomography, expansion microscopy, x-ray microscopy, CLARITY, histology, as well as  physiological images such as calcium imaging, massively parallel electrophysiology, and multi-modal mri, with the corresponding data derivatives including annotations, graphs with rich attributes, and more. 

<!-- 
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>images</strong> both anatomical including electron microscopy, array tomography, expansion microscopy, x-ray microscopy, CLARITY, histology, as well as  physiological images such as calcium imaging, massively parallel electrophysiology, and multi-modal mri;</li>

                            <li><strong>annotations</strong> including volumetric annotations, skeletonizations, and ROIs;</li>

                            <li><strong><u>g</u>raphs</strong> with <u>r</u>ich attrib<u>ute</u>s ("<em>grutes</em>") derived from a wide variety of experimental techniques and scales.</li>

                        </ul>
 -->                    </p>                    


                        <h3>neuroscience</h3>

                        <p>The above described tools, both statistical and computational, are designed and built in the service of answering fundamental questions in neuroscience, both basic and clinical.  The projects we are have worked on, and continue to develop include anatomy, physiology, systems, and <strong>connectome coding</strong>.  Connectome coding is homologous to neural coding, where we learn the rules by which memories & experiences are stored in patterns of connectivity, rather than patterns of activity.

<!--                           <ul>
                              <li><strong>anatomy</strong> including em connectomics, synaptomics, and mesoscale neuro-architecture; </li>

                              <li><strong>physiology</strong> including analysis of correlations from o-phys data;</li>

                                <p>NeuroData is always hiring exceptional individuals at all levels! In fact, even if we are not an optimal choice for your future development as a scientist, we endeavor to assist/support your growth in various ways, including short/extended visits to work with us.  Unfortunately, because our time and funding are limited, we cannot work with everyone that we would love to; nonetheless, please don't hesitate to contact us in case we can provide some guidance :)   We are currently particularly looking for people with their own ideas that they are super passionate about, that we might be able to contribute to, as well any of the <a href="research">above</a> listed projects.</p>

                                <p>Please email your cv (and transcript if appropriate) to <a href="jovo_at_jhu_dot_edu">me</a>.  See below for more details:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>summer intern:</strong> these are really difficult for us to support for anybody not local to JHU.  I recommend trying as much as you can to get research experience at your local university. </li>
                        <li><strong>research associate:</strong> if you have an undergraduate degree in a related field, eg, biomedical engineering, neuroscience, or computer science, perhaps we have some joint interests.</li>
                        <li><strong>current JHU undergrads:</strong> undergraduates are strongly encouraged to take my design course, which i offer annually. this is by far the best way to do research on our team</li>
                        <li><strong>current JHU masters students:</strong>  please contact me as soon as you can, so we can get started right away!</li>
                        <li><strong>current JHU PhD students:</strong>  email me your interests, and we'll find a project for you, or we'll find a faculty better suited for you. </li>
                        <li><strong>potential JHU graduate students: </strong> we are always accepting new students. the best plan is to apply to the <a href="http://www.bme.jhu.edu/graduate/phd/prospective-students">BME PhD program</a>, applications are typically due in late november/early december. i can also advise students in other departments, including biostats, neuroscience, and computer science, so i recommend applying widely to increase the chances that we can work together.</li>
                        <li><strong>postdocs:</strong> we are especially always hiring postdocs! please email me your particular interest in our group and attach your cv.</li>
                    </ul>
