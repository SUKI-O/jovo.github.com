<p>	This world is already an incredibly beautiful and lovely place to live (at least for me, for now).  We are motivated by a desire to make it even better for all of us, as well as our descendants, and our fellow inhabitants.  We do so via searching for <em>patterns</em>.	Specifically, we seek patterns in our physical worlds (e.g., our bodies, our brains) as well as our mental worlds (e.g., our perceptions, experiences, memories, thoughts, emotions, psychiatric conditions).  More importantly, we seek to understand patterns in our mental worlds <em>in terms of</em> our physical worlds. Our hope and belief is that via developing a deeper understanding of the links between these worlds, we will be able to bring them into greater alignment. A primary motivating factor is that all humans/animals have brains and therefore, such ideas could directly benefit all of animalkind. Thus, all of our research products are freely available to all.
